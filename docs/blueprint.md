# **App Name**: Drive-Track

## Core Features:

- Dashboard: Dashboard with tiles for total hours, total miles, night hours; log of recent sessions that includes date, hours, miles, weather conditions, road types driven
- Automatic Driving Tracking: Automatic driving tracking of hours, miles (using GPS), weather from OPEN WEather API, road type (residential, arterial, highway) inferred from driving speed. The automated tracker should include a start/stop button and at the end of a session prompt the use to save, resume, or edit (allowing user to edit data)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5409DA to evoke trust and competence, mirroring the serious nature of driver education. Chosen because this use case is not strongly linked to any industry stereotypes or emotions, and therefore blue makes a solid default, aligning to neutrality.
- Background color: #4E71FF, a very desaturated version of the primary, offering a calm backdrop that reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: #8DD8FF, analogous to blue and used for highlighting interactive elements, drawing user attention to actionable items.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a blend of modern clarity and approachability, suitable for clear presentation of data and informational text.
- Use icons that clearly represent driving and tracking, such as a steering wheel, speedometer, or road. These should be simple, and easy to understand at a glance.
- Ensure a mobile-first, responsive layout to cater specifically to student drivers accessing the tracker on their phones. Data entry form should be prominent.
- Use subtle animations for session data loading, submission confirmations, and timer updates to provide visual feedback without distracting the user.
